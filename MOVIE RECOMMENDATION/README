# üé¨ Movie Recommender System üçø

Welcome to our Movie Recommender System! This system suggests movies similar to the one you select, making your movie-watching experience more delightful. üéâ

## Introduction
This project utilizes content-based filtering to recommend movies based on their similarities in terms of genres, keywords, cast, and crew. It's a handy tool for movie enthusiasts looking for personalized recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Requests

## Dataset
We've used the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset, which contains information about thousands of movies, including their titles, overviews, genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

## How it Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**: We preprocess the dataset by cleaning and transforming the necessary columns, such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
2. **Feature Extraction**: We use the CountVectorizer to convert text data into numerical vectors, which are then used to calculate the cosine similarity between movies.
3. **Recommendation**: When a user selects a movie, the system identifies the most similar movies and displays them as recommendations.
4. **User Interface**: We've built a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the system effortlessly.

## Code Explanation
- The code preprocesses the dataset, calculates cosine similarity, and builds the recommendation system.
- It utilizes CSS for colorful animations and background effects to enhance the user experience.
- Movie posters are fetched dynamically using the TMDB API to provide visual representation alongside movie titles.

## Usage
1. Select a movie from the dropdown menu.
2. Click the "Show Recommendation" button to see similar movie suggestions.
3. Enjoy your personalized movie recommendations!
